# Code Test for talentoMOBILE (MVP with RxAndroid)

Instructions
Please send us back the project inside a	zip file within the next 2	days indicating the starting/finish date and how many hours
you spent on it.
If you have any questions please make assumptions and proceed.
We want to see you implement it	in a	way that you see best fit. There is no right or wrong answer.
If you canâ€™t continue please feel free to send a	message.
Requirements
1. Create a	universal Android/iOS App that shows a	list of accounts.
2. There are two	versions of this list that is displayed: complete list and the list of only visible accounts. How you choose to	
display/switch between these two versions is entirely your own. You can build a	list where the account name, the iban and the	
balance is displayed as inspiration.
3. You also want to be able to show this list in a	different target like Watch /	Widget.
Do not spend time building a	nice interface, we are not interested in that.	
Use the data from the datasource below:
